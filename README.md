# Odin Recipe Website

## Description

This project is a personal project that was created to practise some **HTML** skills I just learned through [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com/)  
In this projects, I used some of the new **HTML** concepts to create a website that talks about different type of **recipes**, the ingredients used to make the recipes and the steps involved in each recipe.

**NOTE**  
This is a project that focuses on practising HTML skills. **Don't** make use of the information on the website for personal purpose. e.g. :smiley: following the steps on the website to prepare a similar recipe. I'm not a chef and I have never made any of the recipe on the website before.

### Key Concepts

- Elements and Tags
- HTML Boilerplate
- Working with Text
- Lists
- Links and Images
- Commit Messages

### Navigation

Your can access the website on [odin recipe website](https://kvsg-7.github.io/Odin-Recipes/recipes/pizza.html)  
From the HomePage, you'll find a link to other pages, where each recipe is being talked about. Also, from each recipe's page, there's a **_Home_** link to the HomePage where you can go back to see the links to other recipes' pages.
